          In the navigation panel at the top of each page (as highlighted above), you can input a keyword to characterize the type of venue you are searching for in the first box and the general location you would like to search around in the second. If you do not enter a location, the location will default to the current city you are in. Hitting search will bring you to the search results page and display a list of businesses for you to browse and select for bookmarking. If you would like more information about a specific venue, simply click on the linked name and a new browser tab will open to its personal Yelp business page.

          <br>
          Upon a successful search, you will see a filter dropdown at the top right corner above your search results (as shown above). This dropdown will be populated with the general categories that results matching your original query fall under. If you see a particular filter that narrows down your search, you may select it and your search will be rerun with that filter in mind. Your results will appear below as in a normal search.

          While browsing through search results, there will be a button below the information for each item to "Bookmark" it under a single or multiple lists. Clicking it will open up a checkbox interface listing the names of all the lists you have currently. After checking the lists you wish to add the item to, clicking "Save Bookmark" will add those items to each list checked. The original "Bookmark" button will then become an "Edit Bookmark" button that will bring up an interface to do so.

          You can also move around items that you have already placed in lists using the bookmarks interface. Displayed items will have an bookmark editing interface similar to the search results page.

          </div>
          <br>

          You can create new lists using the panel on the top right of the bookmarks page. Simply type the name of a list you want to create and click "Add List" and the newly added list will appear below.

          <br>

          You can also create new lists directly from the search results page when bookmarking an item. When bookmarking an item, you may create a new list to add the item to.

           <h3>How do I delete a list that I no longer want?</h3>

          <div align="center">
            <img style="border:5px solid black" src="img/listdelete.png" width="240">
          </div>
          <br>

          Lists can be deleted from the main Bookmarks page by clicking on the "X" icons next to the corresponding list you wish to delete. However, you may not delete the Favorites list, which is a list we provide and suggest you maintain.

          </div>
          <br>

          The Bookmarks link on the navigation bar will bring you to the main YelpLists interface where you will be able to view and edit the bookmarks you have made. Initially no items will be displayed because no lists have been selected for display on the panel to the right. By selecting the checkbox corresponding to the list you wish to display, the frame to the left will populate with the venues that you have placed on that list. You may either select lists singly or select multiple lists at once to display a combined list of venues spanning all selected lists. You may also sort the displayed items by either highest rating or highest number of reviews.
          <br><br>
          If you see an item that you no longer want on a particular list, you will find an "Edit Bookmark" button for each item that you may use to copy or move the item to a new list or remove the item from all lists, similar to the interface you will find on the search results page. You may also create a new list using the right panel to move or copy your bookmarked venues onto.
